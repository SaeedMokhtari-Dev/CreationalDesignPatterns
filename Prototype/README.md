The prototype pattern is a design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, rather than creating new objects by using a class's constructor. The basic idea behind the pattern is that you create a prototype of an object, and then use that prototype to create new instances of the object.

Some key features of the prototype pattern:

• The prototype pattern allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, rather than creating new objects using a class's constructor.

• The prototype object acts as a blueprint for creating new objects.

• The new objects are created by copying the prototype.

There are a number of benefits to using the prototype pattern:

• It allows you to create new objects more quickly and easily than if you were to use a class's constructor.

• It allows you to create new objects that are copies of existing objects, rather than creating new objects that are completely independent.

• It allows you to create new objects that have the same state as the prototype but can be modified independently.

The prototype pattern can be implemented in many ways, but one common way is to create an interface called Clonable or Prototype that defines a method for creating a copy of the object. Classes that want to support being copied can implement this interface and provide an implementation for the method.
