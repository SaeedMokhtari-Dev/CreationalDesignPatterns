The singleton pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. The basic idea behind the pattern is to create a single instance of a class, and to provide a global point of access to that instance.

Some key features of the singleton pattern are:
• The singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
• The singleton pattern uses a private constructor and a static method to ensure that only one instance of the class is created.
• The singleton pattern provides a global point of access to the single instance of the class, typically by using a static property or method.

There are a number of benefits to using the singleton pattern:
• It ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.
• It can be used to control access to resources that are shared across the system, such as a database connection or a configuration object.
• It can be used to implement caching, logging, and other system-wide services.
